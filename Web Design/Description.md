# Web Design

## This folder is designated to code and projects involving website development
## I have practiced HTML 5, CSS, Javascript, PHP, and Ajax and hope these projects can showcase it!
## Each file will have a description here as to the general idea of the project.

### circlesAndSquares.html

This web file has 3 different buttons on it, our tasks were to create a button to add a new box to the row, toggle the type of border the boxes have, and whether they are filled with color or not.

### squareAndTime.html

This web file has two buttons which are coded to do two different things using Javascript. one will create a blue square and the other will create an alert on screen with the date and time.

### jQueryAndAjax.html

This web file is a project we did involving AJAX calls to a rest server on our ceclnx01 server to display information about certain processes on that server, as well as display any errors that may have happened when calling this information.

### forms.html

This html file is a project we did that created a basic HTML form page using PHP and submitted it to the server as well as had it send a reply. The form may not submit due to losing access to the server, however the source code will still be here.
