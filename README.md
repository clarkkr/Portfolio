# Kory Clark's Portfolio

## This GitHub repository contains the final projects from important courses I have taken.

### - The main purpose is to outline and display the skills I have learned and honed throughout Miami University. 
### - Most of our work, especially that involving Web Development was used and stored in Miami's ceclnx01 server.
### - It will be divided into seperate folders based on the coding language.

#### If there is any confusion over anything or any additional questions, feel free to contact me through my phone or email!
