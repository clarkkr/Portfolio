# Senior Design Project

## This folder is dedicated to files from my Senior Design Project

### The project is a scheduling program that creates employee schedules.
### We used HTML, Java, Python, XML, MySQL, GoRules, and a SpringBoot server for this project.
### We also praticed Agile development processes with 2 week sprints.
### I will also attach Markdown files for the individual parts of the project!

I will also provide a general rundown of the flow of the project and its components.

1.) We created mock data for our database and stored it in a json file, employeeTestData.json.

2.) Next, then take this data and run it through our Python script filter.py in order to filter the information using the GoRules rules engine.
  - The rules engine, rulesTest.json was also exported as a JSON file in order to allow it to properly interact with out filter program

3.) Then, we take the filtered information and output it to a webpage on our rest server.
