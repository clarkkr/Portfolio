# Output Type

Our output will be in the form of a website. The file itself is JSON because it will be able to easily be used with the front-end side of the program. 

## Output Plan

> Our big plan is to be able to output multiple schedules in one webpage, with the ability to refresh and choose from multiple schedules if the first one generated is not sufficient.
> We'll display these schedules on our local Spring Boot server webpage and have it sorted by day for each day of the week. There is a config file that allows for changes in the # of employees per shift pattern. 

With this output, we hope the front-end group we are collaborating with will be able to use the file at some point in order to display the employees that are scheduled and what days they are scheduled for.
