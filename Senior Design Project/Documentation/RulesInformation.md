# Rules Engine

The Rules Engine we chose is GoRules.

We chose GoRules for multiple reasons:

1.) Easy implemetation with an interactive user-interface.\
2.) Options to host on our own Cloud server or use their cloud server.\
3.) Ability to hard code functions for our rules, or use decisions / decision tables.\
4.) Simulatable decision making that shows us exactly how it chooses each rule.\
5.) GoRules has the ability to function as a webpage, allowing easy access for all group members.

## Other Options

We also had the thought of choosing EasyRules, which is a java package that we would have to import to our program.

We decided against this option mainly in the interest of time, we spent a lot of time researching posibilities and it turns out that GoRules was overall just more convenient for us.

## How to Start With GoRules

GoRules is a simple to use rule engine, however the only downside to is that starting off you are forced to use their cloud to store your rules unless you export them as a JSON file. However, you can contact the developers with your company info and they might let you run their engine on your own server.

On their website, they have documentation, examples, and what languages the rules engine works with. We were able to understand and implement GoRules with everything there, so it should be fairly simple.
